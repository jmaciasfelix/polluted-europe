## ¿Cómo lo ejecuto en local?

You need to have installed Node.js from version 12 and have access to a terminal to follow the following steps:

```
npm install # install dependencies
npm start # Run app
npm test # Run test
```

**It is important to have the server started, for this, you can follow this guide [README.md](https://github.com/jmaciasfelix/polluted-europe/blob/8c18390247fc4be2dba17bb3deb30ca2ae91e3c3/server/README.md)**
