## How do I run it locally?

This server has been developed using Express and Socket.io. By default the server will send new data every 5 minutes, this can be configured with one of the commands shown below.

You will need to have `Node.js` installed from version 12 and have access to a terminal to follow the following steps:

```
npm start # Run server
npm start 5000 # Run server and response data each 5 seconds
```
